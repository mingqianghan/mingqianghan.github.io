I develop precision farming technologies by integrating advanced sensing hardware, AI/ML, and IoT systems. My work focuses on building end-to-end custom sensor solutions, PCB design, embedded firmware, physics-based modeling, and deep learning pipelines. I'm skilled in Python, C/C++, MATLAB, and IoT protocols, with a strong commitment to creating smart, efficient tools that advance modern agriculture. Feel free to browse the links above to learn more about my work and interests.

Thank you for visiting!
